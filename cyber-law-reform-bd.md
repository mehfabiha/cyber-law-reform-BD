### Weaknesses:
- DSA is often criticized for misuse and for limiting freedom of speech.  
- No specific law for personal data protection.  
- Cyberbullying and harassment laws are not very clear or updated.  
- Not enough focus on AI, FinTech, or national data breaches.  
- No single agency responsible for all cyber issues.

##  Conclusion

Bangladesh is moving fast toward becoming a digital nation. But this progress also brings the danger of cybercrime. The current laws are not enough to fully protect our people, businesses, and government. By learning from countries like the EU, USA, India, Singapore, and Estonia, Bangladesh can design modern, fair, and strong cyber laws. If we want a safe and resilient digital future, we must act now — with smart, clear, and inclusive legal reforms.
